# Probabilistic graphical models in python

This code is intended mainly as proof of concept of the algorithms presented in [1]. The implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested or numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic purposes.

    * Bayesian network (table conditional probability distributions)
    * Markov network (table potentials)
    * Influence diagram

* Inference
    * Variable elimination
    * Forward sampling
    * Gibbs sampling

* Learning
    * Parameter learning (maximum likelihood, uniform BDe, expectation maximization for missing data)
    * Structure learning (local search, likelihood score, BIC score, Bayesian score)
